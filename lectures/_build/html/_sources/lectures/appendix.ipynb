    "In this course you will be using a Fork-Pull Request workflow on GitHub, where the main GitHub repository is under the UBC-MDS organization and you have your own fork off of that. You will send your contributions from your own fork to the main repository as a pull request, and another team member will review and accept them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inadvertently, your fork will fall behind the main repository in the UBC-MDS organization. Here's how you catch your repository back up:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you need to catch up, you have to tell your computer where the upstream repository (here the one in the UBC-MDS organization)  is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add upstream <original_repo_URL>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to catch up this time (and any other time) you type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git fetch upstream\n",
    "git merge upstream/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two commands together are like a git pull from the repo you forked. And will update the repository on your laptop. To update your fork of the repository on GitHub.com you will need to push:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can now use RStudio as an effective Python IDE. To do so, follow these steps after installing miniconda:\n",

    "1. Install the {reticulate} package: `install.packages(\"reticulate\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install the {png} package (a dependency of reticulate that is not well managed yet): `install.packages(\"png\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find your path to miniconda by typing `which python` in a terminal (Git Bash on Windows) outside of RStudio\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specify that {reticulate} should use the miniconda version of Python in your `.Rprofile` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - type `usethis::edit_r_profile` into the R console inside RStudio, and an `.Rprofile` file from your HOME directory should open in RStudio\n",
    "  - add this to your `.Rprofile` file: `Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = \"path_to_miniconda's_python\")` replacing `\"path_to_miniconda's_python\"` with the path to your miniconda Python\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. In terminal type `code ~/.bash_profile` and add the line `export PATH=\"/opt/miniconda3/bin:$PATH\"`, replacing `/opt/miniconda3/bin` with the path to the folder containing your miniconda Python (be careful not to include `python` at the end of this path). \n",
    "  \n",
    "6. **Restart R!**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Start using Python in RStudio by typing `repl_python()` in the R console, or running a line of Python code from a Python script from the RStudio editor by Cntrl + enter. Or by running scripts from the terminal inside RStudio.\n",
    "\n",

In Windows, you need `\\\\` instead of a `\\` to separate the directories, for example my path here would be: `C:\\\\Users\\\\tiffany.timbers\\\\miniconda3\\\\python.exe`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Open Global Options in RStudio and in the Terminal sub-menu, select \"Custom\" as the \"New terminals to open with\" option, and add the path to GitBash (should be something like `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe`) as the \"Custom shell binary\" option.
