    "We previously built a data analysis pipeline by using a shell script (we called it `run_all.sh`) to piece together and create a record of all the scripts and arguments we used in our analysis. That is a step in the right direction, but there were a few unsatisfactory things about this strategy:\n",

    "  1. It takes time to manually erase all intermediate and final files generated by analysis to do a complete test to see that everything is working from top to bottom\n",
